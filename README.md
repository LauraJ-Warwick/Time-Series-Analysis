Many businesses are seeing a shift into digital channels and this insight will be useful in helping them understand where their digital infrastructure needs to be in the future. It can also be used as guide to determine how their business is performing compared to the average. In turn, this analysis could help drive decisions needed to expand businessâ€™s digital capabilities to keep in line with evolving customer behaviour.
